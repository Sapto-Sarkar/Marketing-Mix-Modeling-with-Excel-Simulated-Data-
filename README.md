# ðŸ“ˆ Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) â€“ Excel-Based Simulation

This project showcases an end-to-end Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) workflow built entirely in Microsoft Excel using **simulated 30-week data**. The objective was to explore the influence of media spends on sales, apply key transformation techniques like **adstock** and **diminishing returns**, and optimize advertising spend to minimize **Cost per Output (CPO)**.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- âœ… Simulated 30 weeks of weekly marketing data (3 media spend variables + 1 sales column)
- âœ… Performed exploratory data analysis (scatter plots, Pearson correlation)
- âœ… Built a baseline linear regression model  
  â€¢ RÂ² = 0.84  
  â€¢ RMSE = 2.05  
  â€¢ MAPE = 12%
- âœ… Checked for multicollinearity using VIF
- âœ… Applied **adstock** and **diminishing return** transformations
- âœ… Tuned hyperparameters (decay & alpha) to improve model
- âœ… Final model performance:  
  â€¢ RÂ² = 0.88  
  â€¢ RMSE = 1.73  
  â€¢ MAPE reduced from 12% to 10%
- âœ… Used **Excel Solver** to optimize marketing budget allocation
- âœ… Achieved **CPO = â‚¹26.77** for predicted sales of **1.47**

## ðŸ“Š Key Techniques Used

- **Adstock Transformation** â€“ Models carryover effects of advertising
- **Diminishing Returns** â€“ Captures saturation of media impact
- **Solver Optimization** â€“ Finds lowest possible CPO for given budget
- **Manual Hyperparameter Tuning** â€“ For best-fit decay and saturation rates
- **Data Visualization** â€“ Includes scatter plots, diminishing curves, and adstock decay trends
